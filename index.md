To get the most out of the Python language, it's important to get familiar with the
fundamental programming concepts that it is based on. This way you can easily integrate
the large amount of external code and modules available into your own code.

Though the topics covered here are by no means everything Python has to offer, they do
go over the main concepts you are most likely to need in a typical Data Science role.
Luckily, this basic Python syntax isn't too complicated and has actually been designed to
make it as easily understandable as possible.
